SUMMARY:The Trojans
LOCATION:wmoh
DESCRIPTION:MUSIC BY Hector Berlioz  	The Fall of Troy and The Trojans at Carthage 	Libretto by the composer 	 	NEW PRODUCTION 	 	 		 			 				 					One of the largest\, most magnificent pieces in the entire repertory\, this rarely staged epic is presented here for the first time in 47 years\, the way it was originally meant to be seen: two operas--The Fall of Troy and The Trojans at Carthage--in one spectacular evening! The tragic fall of Troy\, the passionate love of two great leaders\, the urgent pull of destiny: all unfold as part of Berlioz's visionary masterpiece--French grand opera's answer to Wagner's Ring. Former Music Director Donald Runnicles\, who masterfully conducted the Ring cycle in 2011\, returns to lead this intensely lyrical\, colorfully orchestrated\, viscerally exciting score. David McVicar's visually striking new production\, "a major event" (The Guardian\, London)\, moves the action to the mid-19th century. The world-class cast stars\, as the ill-fated lovers Dido and Aeneas\, the "vocally sumptuous and alluring" Susan Graham and Bryan Hymel\, who gives "an impassioned and confident performance of a heroic role" (The New York Times). The "musically intelligent and vocally splendid" Anna Caterina Antonacci (The New York Times) alternates with Michaela Martens to take on the dramatic role of the prophetess Cassandra.

SUMMARY:Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg
LOCATION:WMOH
DESCRIPTION:MUSIC BY Richard Wagner  	Libretto by the composer 	 	The best singer-songwriter gets the girl. 	 	In his comic masterpiece\, Wagner set aside gods and goddesses to tell a touchingly human story about the power of art.

Acclaimed Wagnerian Sir Mark Elder conducts a stellar cast headed by two San Francisco Opera favorites--Greer Grimsley as Hans Sachs and Brandon Jovanovich as Walther. Sir David McVicar's beautifully conceived staging is "remarkable for the detailed naturalism of its performances" (The Guardian\, London). 	  	Sung in German with English supertitles 	5 hours\, 15 minutes including two intermissions 	Please note: Evening performances begin at 6pm and the matinee at 1pm 	 	Discover more: Learn about the cast\, read a full synopsis\, listen to audio highlights and view media spotlights.

SUMMARY:Carmen
LOCATION:WMOH
DESCRIPTION:MUSIC BY Georges Bizet  	Libretto by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Hal&#233\;vy 	 	Be swept into her deadly seduction as never before. 	  	The ultimate femme fatale returns in a provocative staging by bad-boy director Calixto Bieito in his long-awaited U.S. opera debut. 	 	Set in the arid earthiness of post-Franco Spain\, Bieito's raw and cinematic vision of Carmen unabashedly provokes the intense emotions pulsing through this tale of love\, lust and murder. The result is an uncompromising account of a defiantly free-spirited woman and her compulsive\, obsessive lover. 	  	This strikingly bold new production features two casts. One stars the captivating Irene Roberts as the impassioned Gypsy\, Brian Jagde as the lovesick soldier\, Nadine Sierra as the innocent Mica&#235\;la and Zachary Nelson as the dashing bullfighter.
